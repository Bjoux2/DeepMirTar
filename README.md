# DeepMirTar
Stack denoising autoencoder (SdA) code of "Deep learning based functional site-level and UTR-level human miRNA target prediction". The code was rewritten from www.deeplearning.net 

The usage of the SdA is similar to sklean:

# pseudo-example:

from SdA_wm import SdA

sda_classifier = SdA()

sda_classifier.pretraining(train_x) 

sda_classifier.finetuning(train_x, train_y, valid_x, valid_y)    # the valid set is used to optimize the parameters

y_pred = sda_classifier.predict(test_y)

>>>More detaild example, see test_SdA.py

# Dependencies:
