## Version 0.1

> Caution: This is a developer preview. 

Since Theano is no longer update and Python2.7 will not support in 2020, and the configure of dependences of orignal model is difficult, I changed to use Tensorflow/Keras and Python 3.6. 

A new model was trained (the data used in the training the model is identical as original). The model in this version is not well optimised. A better model will be released in few days.
